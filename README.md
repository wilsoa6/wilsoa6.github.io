## Highlighted Projects
- **[PolyID](https://polyid.nrel.go): Inverse Bio-product Design (NREL)** – This technology was developed to discover novel bio-based polymers and chemicals using graph neural networks. Within the program, we mapped physical polymer structures to the right ML architectures and integrated multimodal data (experimental, computational, 2D/3D representations) to create a state-of-the-art tool to guide experimental research. I served as the technical expert in machine learning, led as PI, and developed the web application. The technology was deployed to 6 partnered projects, both private and government, to guide synthesis of sustainable materials. I contributed to 3 records of invention, 2 software records of invention, 1 provision patent (2 additional in draft), 2 open-sourced python packages, and 2 published manuscripts.
- **Process Development of Biobased Coproducts** (NREL) – We developed chemical products from biomass pyrolysis streams. I served as the lead expert in separations and synthesis. We isolated phenol, catechol, and 2-cyclopenten-1-one at above >95% purity. We produced bio-based bisphenol A, a poly(ether ether ketone), and a phenol-formaldehyde resin. The work produced 4 manuscripts, 1 patent, 2 provisional patents, and directly contributed to cost reduction targets set by DOE.
- **Machine Learning for High Throughput Process Design** (NREL) – This project created a machine learning-based process models that was orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional process models (i.e., Aspen) and can be programmatically implemented. I conceptualized this idea, successfully procured funding from DOE, built the project team, and served as a technical lead overseeing machine learning. The project began in 2021 and resulted in an open-source code base.
- **Catalyst Datahub (NREL)** – This project accelerated catalyst development by establishing a open-source database for research community. I served as program lead in 2023 and established the research goals of the next 3 years. We secured funding from DOE to purse a “Catalyst Design Engine” to accelerate experimental advancements through data-driven, ML-based hypothesis.
- **Commercial Scaleup of Specialty Injectable** (Tolmar) – We scaled-up a process that was approved by the FDA for the commercial production of an extended-release pharmaceutical product. I served as lead engineer and oversaw procurement, equipment installation/operation qualification, process scaleup, and process validation. The outcome of our work was the first specialty injectable submission to the FDA by Tolmar in over 15 years. 
- **Molecular Feedback Loops for Drug Delivery** (Clemson) – In this project, I used both multiphysics modeling and experimental efforts to demonstrate attenuation and control over enzymatic activity through the triggered release of inhibitors from hydrogels. This resulted in 2 published manuscripts and was the basis for my PhD thesis.
